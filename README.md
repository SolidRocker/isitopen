## Filtering Restaurants

To look for a restaurant by name, or to check whether it's open at a specific time, use the FILTER table.
Under [Filter Type], you can chose whether to filter by name or a timeslot.
The [Filter Lits] section will then update accordingly.
From there, choose the name or timeslot to check, and check out the available restaurants!

## Collections

To gain access to collections, you first have to login.
Upon logging in, you will be able to see both your collections and your shared collections.
To create or view the collections, simply click on them!

### Add Restaurant To Collection

Once a collection is created, you can start browsing the restaurants.
There is a red [Add To Collection] button next to the restaurant when you hover over it.
Just click on it, and it will prompt you which collection you want to add it to!

### Renaming Collections

When you first create the collection, you will be prompted to give it a name.
You can also change it later, by clicking on collecttion -> Rename.
You can also rename your friend's collections!

### Sharing Collections

To share a collection with your friends, click on collection -> Share.
You will then be prompted to enter your friend's email address. Note that it must be:
 - An already registered user
 - A user whom the collection is not shared to
 - A user other than yourself
